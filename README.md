**Introduction:** Mike Bloomberg is a multimillionaire, ex-mayor of NYC, and most recently a 2020 prediential nominee. Since he joined the campaign late, he now has to play catch-up with the other nominees to leave a significant impression on the public, and in order to do this, he has invested a very substatial ammount of money into campaigning and ad's. Most recently, he has resorted to throwing over $1million into memes made by Meme2020 and other users. This begs to question, how effective has his campaign strategy been at leaving an impression on the younger audience on snapchat?
In order to investigate this question, we will look at Snapchat's public campaign data and isolate Bloomberg's ad's via sort and filter. Next, we will use Linear Regression to see how well his spending coorelates with the number of impressions he left. We will primarily investigate significance of "spending" on "impressions" via the P-value, the coefficient of spending (in order to see how much each impression is worth), and the standard error of spending to investigate how much variation there is in the data.

This graph indicates that spending and impressions generally do have a linear trend. The R^2 value implies that only 48.5% of the impression increase can be explained by spending. In order to check how significant of an effect spending has on coorelation though, we must use linear regression to find P

**Conclusion:** With this data in place, the P-value tells us that spending has a signficant impact on impressions since P is much less than 0.05. Based on this analysis, there is about a 95% chance of recieving an impression if Bloomberg spends $177-309. Bloomberg's spending has been substatial, but he is most certainly leaving an impression on the Snap-Chat medium.
